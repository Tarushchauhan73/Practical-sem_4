1. Aim/Overview of the practical: Creating branches with GitHub and merge them.

2. Task to be done:
We will make the branches in git hub and in bash and merge them.
3. Steps -in git hub
 
. Open git hub and open your repository.

. In repository there is the main branch and we make sub branches of that main
Branch .

6. When we do some change in the main branch of that repository than the sub branch
created .
7. In this picture we make some changes which passes with the green colour.

9. After changing ,create pull request .
10. The sub branch and the main branch is ready to merge after pulling .
11. After pulling ,it checks for the conflicts .
If conflicts occur it resolve the conflicts automatically.

11. After merging the file it is successfully merged and closed.

3. Make the clone of that file using, git clone file link.

5.After making the file, write into the file using cat(concatenate) command.

9. After write into the file use git add command to add three files .
10. To save the file we use commit command.
11. For switching the branches we use checkout command.
12. We use ls command to list all file .
10.Do some changes in the f1 file using cat command .
11.After doing catenation and checkout ,we have to commit the changes and after
committing it shows all the updation ,deletion etc.

12.Than we have to merge the files.
13.After merging the file we have to check the status using git status command.
